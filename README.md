## Introduction
Automated API Testing – a collection of automated API tests cases to verificate and validate email addresses, using Postman technology.

Why API testing? 

1. [Exact bug localization]
For example REST API ensures communication between the client and the server using HTTP requests (Get, Post, Put, Delete…), HTTP requests contain the client's query, the answer is contained in the response body. In some cases manually testing interface is impossible to localize certain bugs. Api testing consists in obtaining responses directly from the server, thus omitting the long and often unreliable way of manual testing, so the tester is able to quick obtain an accurate response from the server about bug localization. 

2. [Time]
API testing is much faster and more efficient than graphical user interface testing. Manually testing consume a lot of time and focus, sometimes one wrong click can ruin the test result and the work must be done from the beginning. In this case Api testing can save you a lot of time.

3. [Api testing can be started at the very beginning]
Api testing can be started at the initial stage of the software development life cycle, before the user interface is ready. Thanks to which we can achieve two advantages:
-first we can find bugs at a very early stage of the software development cycle, this means that the cost of repairing a bug is low,
-second we can start intensive testing phase from the very beginning, which helps us achieve high quality at the initial stage of the software development life cycle.

4. [The ability to participate in projects where working with API becomes necessary to design tests]
Nowadays one of the most popular  architecture is the architecture of microservices, when the application is not monolithic but becomes a superset of independent applications which exchange data with each other. In this case, API testing becomes particularly desirable, be-cause it allows to check the correctness of integration between separate services and ma-intaining the logic of the system functioning. That is why in this kind of project some tests should be reproduced only through software interfaces.The ability to participate in projects where working with API becomes necessary to design tests.

Why use Postman technology to test API?

All saved queries sync in the cloud. In addition to sending queries to the API, Postman has a Tests tab, which allows you to enter the script using JavaScript. Thanks to this, we can test our response received from the API

Thanks to the possibility of introducing test scripts, Postman can allow us to automate the verification of websites. The benefit of introducing automation to our queries will be the ability to perform regression tests smoothly.
