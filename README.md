## Introduction
Automated API Testing ‚Äì a collection of automated API tests cases to verificate and validate email addresses, using Postman technology.

Why API testing is more efficient and accurate than manual testing?

1. [Exact bug localization] 
For example REST API ensures communication between the client and the server using HTTP requests (Get, Post, Put, Delete‚Ä¶), HTTP requests contain the client's query, the answer is contained in the response body. In some cases manually testing interface is impossible to localize certain bugs. Api testing consists in obtaining responses directly from the server, thus omitting the long and often unreliable way of manual testing, so the tester is able to quick obtain an accurate response from the server about bug localization. 

2. [Time]
API testing is much faster and more efficient than graphical user interface testing. Manually testing consume a lot of time and focus, sometimes one wrong click can ruin the test result and the work must be done from the beginning. In this case Api testing can save you a lot of time.

3. [Api testing can be started at the very beginning]
Api testing can be started at the initial stage of the software development life cycle, before the user interface is ready. Thanks to which we can achieve two advantages:
-first we can find bugs at a very early stage of the software development cycle, this means that the cost of repairing a bug is low,
-second we can start intensive testing phase from the very beginning, which helps us achieve high quality at the initial stage of the software development life cycle.

4. [The ability to participate in projects where working with API becomes necessary to design tests]
Nowadays one of the most popular  architecture is the architecture of microservices, when the application is not monolithic but becomes a superset of independent applications which exchange data with each other. In this case, API testing becomes particularly desirable, be-cause it allows to check the correctness of integration between separate services and ma-intaining the logic of the system functioning. That is why in this kind of project some tests should be reproduced only through software interfaces.The ability to participate in projects where working with API becomes necessary to design tests.

Why use Postman technology to test API?

1. All saved queries sync in the cloud. In addition to sending queries to the API, Postman has a Tests tab, which allows you to enter the script using JavaScript. Thanks to this, we can test our response received from the API

2. Thanks to the possibility of introducing test scripts, Postman can allow us to automate the verification of websites. The benefit of introducing automation to our queries will be the ability to perform regression tests smoothly.

## Description

So the first way to test API requires writing request, using endpoint according to disify doc-umentation writing endpoint - requires just email parameter and email address

Positive single email test verification get response - results displayed in JSON string, as above with additional information that email is whitelisted (it wasn‚Äôt mentioned in the doc-umentation)

{
    "format": true,
    "domain": "gmail.com",
    "disposable": false,
    "dns": true,
    "whitelist": true
}

Thanks to Json response, you can analyze if it`s the same as in the documentation.

Apart from Response analyze, you can run both functional and performing tests and much more üòä 
Postman has written automated test cases snippets in Java Script, therefore writing test cases is faster and more enjoyable üòä

Modyfing the postman snippets tests you can test:

1 server response, 
pm.test("Successful email verification", function () {
    pm.response.to.have.status(200);
});
2. response time ‚Äì necessary in performance testing 
pm.test("Response time is less than 1s", function () {
    pm.expect(pm.response.responseTime).to.be.below(1000);
});
3. the Response json string from the disify documentation (format, domain, disposable, dns) written below, verification format test case for valid email format 
I. single email verification
pm.test("When email is correct response should contain format property equals true", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.format).to.eql(true);
});
In Contrast disposable test case for non-disposable email format differs variable json data disposable to equals false as below:
pm.test("When email is non-disposa-ble response should contain disposable property equals false", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.disposable).to.eql(false);
});
Response can differ from the documentation. Inability to recognize the email format (with-out @) can occur an information:
{
    "format": false
} 
Server cannot recognize format of the domain that`s why response doesn`t contain infor-mation about domain, disposable and dns.
But non-existing email domain in response contains information about valid format, fic-tional domain name, non disposable and false dns
{
    "format": true,
    "domain": "il.com",
    "disposable": false,
    "dns": false
}
 
Testing two disposable email addresses and comparing responses.
First disposable email was generated by thichanthit domain (hezywope@thichanthit.com) after sending request, get a response body which doesn`t contain information about dns:
{
    "format": true,
    "domain": "thichanthit.com",
    "disposable": true
}
Second disposable email was generated by bunlets.com domain (sigoce8002@bunlets.com)
In this case body response contain wrong information about email disposable equals false while this email address actually is disposable! 
Response also contain information about dns, unlike in the case of disposable email test case above.
{
    "format": true,
    "domain": "bunlets.com",
    "disposable": false,
    "dns": true
}
According to disposable test cases, 
pm.test("When email is disposable response should contain disposable property equals true", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.disposable).to.eql(true);
});
the response is incomprehensible, because expected is true while in the test result: ex-pected false to deeply equal true
When email is disposable response should contain disposable property equals true | AssertionError: expected false to deeply equal true

Bug occurred also while testing email dns test case was written:
pm.test("When email is disposable response should not contain dns property", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.dns).to.eql(undefined);
});
the response is one more time incomprehensible, because expected is undefined while in test result is written expected false to deeply equal true
AssertionError: expected true to deeply equal undefined

In the case of disposable emails sourced from different domains dns and disposable verifi-cation failed, the response body is confusing test results are incomprehensible.

Post request ‚Äì the response body is compatible with indications of documentation, tests have been passed property.

II. Mass emails verification 
Endpoint should include a few email address
Response should have json string from
{
    "total": 2,
    "invalid_format": 0,
    "invalid_dns": 0,
    "disposable": 0,
    "unique": 2,
    "valid": 2,
    "session": "e12000d147c27daf1244f3696f4df9b3"
}
Testing two email addresses response is compatible witch indications of documentation.

Error occurs while testing one disposable (hezywope@thichanthit.com) and one non-disposable email address, after sending correct request, respond body contains information that valid address emails equals 1 while request contains two valid emails. (Must note that body contains correct information about total addresses number, invalid format, disposable and unique.)
Test case:
pm.test("When checking two valid emails response should contain valid property equals 2", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.valid).to.eql(2);
});
Got a result AssertionError: expected 1 to deeply equal 2
Result is confusing.

Error occurs while testing one disposable (dixiwov868@roxoas.com) and one non-disposable email address. Respond body contains information that disposable equals ‚Äú0‚Äù while one of the checked email address is actually disposable.
Test case:
pm.test("When checking one disposable email and one non-disposa-ble email response should include disposable equals 1", function () {
    var jsonData = pm.response.json();
    pm.expect(jsonData.disposable).to.eql(1);
});
Got a result When checking one disposable email and one non-disposable email response should include disposable equals 1 | AssertionError: expected 0 to deeply equal 1
Result is confusing.

Post request while verifying two email addresses ‚Äì the response body is compatible with indications of documentation, tests have been passed property.



## Conclusion:

Api testing consume less time than manual testing, can exact localize a bug, using Api test-ing, testing interfaces programming can start at a very beginning of software development lifecycle, which can save time and money. Moreover nowadays technology use micro-services architectures, and preparing test cases for this kind of project requires good knowledge of Api testing.
Using Postman technology, you can fast write test cases using Postman snippets and what is important you can save them in certain  collection, which enable fast automated regres-sion testing every time you need it.
There are also some cons, Api testing not inludes some logic of backed which in some ex-ample can occure as confusing and unclear test result.
